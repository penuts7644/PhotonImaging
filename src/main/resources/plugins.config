# Name: Process Pixels
# Author: Lonneke Scheffer and Wout van Helvoirt
# Version: 1.0

# A single .jar file can contain multiple plugins, specified in separate lines.
#
# The format is: <menu>, "<menu label>", <class name>
#
# If something like ("<arg>") is appended to the class name, the setup() method
# will get that as arg parameter; otherwise arg is simply the empty string.
#
# Note: for ImageJ/Fiji to recognize plugin, jar and class file need underscore
# in the file name.
